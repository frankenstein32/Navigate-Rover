An introductory AI game web-app

## Introduction 
- An AI game that is featured with the web development tool in order to serve it on a platform.
- Game consists of a 2D Grid which contains source point, destination points and some blocked cells.
- The algorithm finds the shortest path between the source and destination point.
- Various options are available for which algorithm should be used in order to find the path.
- The app also contains the bi-directionality and diagonal-moves features which can make the path shortest.
- The upcoming aim for this project is to connect it with the backend inorder to save points of the corresponding player.
- To make the game interesting 🧐 some additional features will be introduced in future. Stay tuned 😋❤️

__Note__ : The project will be made in progress and hence the versions made in between will be uploaded too on the readme under the discarded versions section.

### Features 
1. Source and Destination positions are already plotted on grid
2. Instead of clickable the grid is scrollable to select
3. For now svg tags are used to plot the grid but will convert it with canvas
